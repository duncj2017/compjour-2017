- Currently Professor of the Practice, teaching [data journalism at Northeastern University](https://camd.northeastern.edu/journalism/people/matthew-carroll/)
- Was part of [the Pulitzer Prize Spotlight team investigating priest abuse](http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/spotlight-movie).
- Is [known as the spreadsheet-guy in the "Spotlight" movie](http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/spotlight-movie), in which he uses a spreadsheet.

## Questions

### 1. That data scene in the Spotlight movie

Can you quickly describe what's going on in the [following 33 second clip](https://www.youtube.com/embed/rDf_ZEvCpn4)? Did it get the details right? Did it get any wrong? Were there any parts that were cut out for brevity?

What important aspect or subtask of the real-world data work is not in the movie?

I don't get what's going on in these questions:

- **0:03** - What book is being marked up?
- **0:03** - **0:22** - What is the significance of marking Paul Mahan (or any of the names) as having sick leave?
- **0:25** - The scene switches from your colleagues marking up books to you at a computer doing manual transcription. What are you transcribing?
- **0:28** - Did you really type those names in all lower-case? Didn't that annoy your editors?

### 2. Reporter to database-reporting

Your [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewscarroll) lists your job title at the Globe as "Reporter/databases" from 1987 to 2014. Can you give a little more detail about how your role changed in those years? What kind of reporting did you start out doing? When did your role explicitly include databases? And how did you get into that role, where did you learn about it, who did you work with, and how often were databases and spreadsheet part of your daily workflow?

### 3. What's so special about Spotlight?

In [*Shining the Globe’s Spotlight on the Catholic Church*](http://niemanreports.org/articles/shining-the-globes-spotlight-on-the-catholic-church/), Walter V. Robinson described the Spotlight team:

> Here at the Globe, investigative reporting is good work if you can get it. In a typical year, the four-person Spotlight Team produces two or three investigative series, with the pace broken up now and then with a one-day special report that might be turned around relatively quickly—in perhaps two or three weeks. For reporters accustomed to the frontlines of daily newspapering, Spotlight has long offered the lure of never having to write a lead that contains the word “yesterday.” Until Martin Baron moved from The Miami Herald into the Globe editor’s chair on July 30, 2001, it was a job you could do and still get home for dinner.

In your experience at the Globe, what were tangible forms of cachet that you had being on Spotlight, versus being an enterprising reporter at any other desk? When were you firsrt selected, and how/why were you selected to be on the team? How much did your data skills contribute to you being seen as a valued team member? 

### 4. Hindsights and hypotheticals about the lack of investigation before 2002?

In the movie, and in various other reported accounts, such as [Sarah Larson's article in the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/spotlight-and-its-revelations), it seems to be accepted that Marty Baron was the pivotal force in focusing Spotlight on the priest investigation, even in his very first news meeting:

>  At the Globe, Baron said, his first day’s editorial meeting was much as it was depicted in “Spotlight.” “We went around the table and people mentioned their stories,” he said. “And I asked them about Eileen’s column and said, ‘One side’s saying one thing, we have another side saying something else. Isn’t there a way we can get at the truth?’ And people noted that the documents were under seal. I said I knew that, and I don’t know the laws of Massachusetts, but in Florida we might have wanted to go to court to unseal the documents. Had we thought of doing that? And there was dead silence in the room. I didn’t quite know how to respond.”

It almost seems that luck played a part -- if Baron hadn't read [Eileen McNamara's column as he made his move to Boston](http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news5/2001_07_29_McNamara_Passing_the_Buck.htm), he would've never challenged the Spotlight team to get the documents, even though McNamara's column indicated that shocking revelations about the Church were already known.

One powerful scene has lawyer Eric MacLeish lashing out at the Spotlight team for burying the story in Metro back in 1993 (I [think this might be the story](http://archive.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/archives/120993_accusations.htm)). Former Globe reporter Allison Bass wrote a blog post in which she agreed with the movie's insinuiation that the Globe was afraid of the Catholic Church, and that [editors conspired to stifle the reporting she did as early as 1990](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alison-bass/boston-priest-scandal-story-spotlight_b_9041238.html).

From your perspective, besides  a changing of the executive editors, what circumstances in 2002 made it possible for the investigation to go forward rather than stall as it did in the 90s? Why weren't the known violations of Father Porter and older priests enough to spark a full-on investigation?



### 5. Your data playbook vs. the reality of the investigation

Going into priest investigation, how much of the data/computer-assisted approach and game plan was obvious, based on your experience? What kind of data challenges did you have in this project that you hadn't encountered before? How much of the data plan was ad-hoc?

Could you give more detail about the idea of reviewing the "Boston Catholic Directory for every year since the early 1980s?"

Whose idea was it, and what sparked it? How difficult was the work, in terms of pure labor, data management, etc., compared to what you had anticipated?

### 6. How did the Spotlight team work on data

Were you the only data expert on the Spotlight team? How was the work of data distributed between the other team members, and how much did you have to manage/hand-hold the process? Were you responsible for teaching the team data concepts?

### 7. Spotlight vs Watergate, the movie

Pretend that "Spotlight" and "All the President's Men" were both competing for Best Picture in the same year. Describe your approach and talking points in successfully convincing the Academy and fellow journalists why "Spotlight" deserves to be Best Picture as well as the real-life journalism movie to rule all such movies.
